# Swipe Component

Simple Swipe Component for React Native.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need React, React Native, React Native Elements and Expo XDE (to view the app on an iOS/Android device).

Best done by using npm (will need Node.js for npm)

### Installation

1) Download/Clone the Project. 

2) Download an IDE (I used Visual Studio Code, if you want to view/change the code)

3) Navigate to project directory using any CLI (I used terminal on Mac) and execute the following steps:

    a) Install Node (npm is installed automatically):

    ```
    https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
    ```

    b) Install React

    ```
    npm i react
    ```

    c) Install React Native

    ```
    npm i react-native
    ```

    d) Install React Native Elements

    ``` 
    npm i react-native-elements
    ```

    e) Install Expo XDE on machine (there is a browser version I haven't used) and download the app on iOS/Android

    ``` 
    Desktop: https://expo.io/learn
    App: App Store/Play Store
    ```

4) Open the project in Expo XDE (may have to sign up, its free) and click on send link (only have to do this once)

5) Open Expo on device, open the project and use it
